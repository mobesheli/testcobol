## What Was Validated

### ✅ COBOL Source Code
- `main.cob` (37 lines) - User interface and menu handling
- `operations.cob` (41 lines) - Transaction processing logic
- `data.cob` (24 lines) - Balance storage management

### ✅ Node.js Implementation
- `main.js` (48 lines) - Modernized user interface
- `operations.js` (31 lines) - Modernized transaction logic
- `data.js` (15 lines) - Modernized data storage

### ✅ Documentation
- `README.md` - System overview and compilation instructions
- `TESTPLAN.md` - Test cases for all operations
- `docs/rules/` - Detailed business rules analysis (4 files)

---

## Issues Found and Corrected

### 1. Line Reference Error (FIXED) ✅
**Issue:** BRD referenced `data.cob:9` for STORAGE-BALANCE  
**Correct:** Should be `data.cob:6`  
**Status:** Corrected in BRD line 12

### 2. Missing Data Element (ADDED) ✅
**Issue:** FINAL-BALANCE variable not documented in BRD  
**Solution:** Added to BRD line 12  
**Status:** Complete

### 3. Amount Validation Gap (ADDED) ✅
**Issue:** Zero/negative amount handling not explicitly specified  
**Solution:** Added VR-06 validation rule to FRD  
**Status:** Complete

### 4. Enhanced Amount Validation (IMPROVED) ✅
**Issue:** VR-03 lacked specific error handling details  
**Solution:** Enhanced with range and error specifications  
**Status:** Complete

### 5. Missing I/O Specification (ADDED) ✅
**Issue:** Error messages not in I/O table  
**Solution:** Added error messages row to FRD I/O table  
**Status:** Complete

### 6. New Business Rule (ADDED) ✅
**Issue:** Amount boundaries not explicitly stated as business rule  
**Solution:** Added BR-09 to BRD and traceability matrix  
**Status:** Complete

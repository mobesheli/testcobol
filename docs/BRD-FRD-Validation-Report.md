## 6. Gap Analysis

### 6.1 Missing or Incomplete Elements

| Element | Current Status | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| FINAL-BALANCE data element | Not in BRD line 12 | Add to File Layouts section | Low |
| Zero amount handling | Mentioned in TESTPLAN only | Add validation rule to FRD | Medium |
| Negative amount inputs | Not explicitly addressed | Add validation rule (VR-06) | Medium |
| Maximum transaction limit | Implied but not stated as rule | Add business rule explicitly | Low |
| Console error display format | Not specified | Add to I/O specifications | Low |

### 6.2 Recommended Additions

#### For BRD (Brd.md):
1. **Add FINAL-BALANCE to line 12:** "...while control flags such as `CONTINUE-FLAG PIC X(3)` (`main.cob:6`) and working variables like `FINAL-BALANCE PIC 9(6)V99` (`operations.cob:8`) govern loop continuation and transaction processing."

2. **Add explicit rule for amount boundaries:** After line 21, add: "**Amount Boundaries**: Transaction amounts must be positive and non-zero; the system accepts values from 0.01 to 999,999.99, rejecting negative or out-of-range entries."

#### For FRD (Frd.md):
1. **Add VR-06 Positive Amount:** After line 33, add:
   ```markdown
   - **VR-06 Positive Amount**: Reject negative or zero amounts for credit and debit transactions; display error message and re-prompt.
   ```

2. **Enhance VR-03:** Update line 31 to specify behavior for invalid inputs:
   ```markdown
   - **VR-03 Amount Format**: Enforce numeric input with two decimal places in range 0.01-999,999.99; reject non-numeric, negative, or out-of-range values and prompt for re-entry.
   ```

3. **Add Console Message Specifications:** After line 26, add a row:
   ```markdown
   | Error Messages | Transaction Processing Module | Alphanumeric text | N/A | Console | Error-specific messages (invalid input, insufficient funds). |
   ```

## 7. Modernization Alignment

### 7.1 Pain Points Coverage ✅ EXCELLENT

BRD Pain Points (lines 34-39) are comprehensive:
- Session-only storage ✅
- Single-account limitation ✅
- No authentication/audit ✅
- Console-only interface ✅
- No transaction history ✅

### 7.2 Modernization Objectives ✅ STRATEGIC

BRD Modernization Objectives (lines 41-46) provide clear direction:
- Durable persistence ✅
- Multi-account support ✅
- APIs/GUIs ✅
- Enhanced validation ✅
- Service extensibility ✅

**Finding:** Modernization section effectively bridges legacy documentation to future requirements.

---

## 8. Cross-Reference Validation

### 8.1 Line References Accuracy ✅ VERIFIED

All cited line numbers were validated against actual COBOL files:
- `main.cob:12` (PERFORM UNTIL) ✅ Correct
- `main.cob:6` (CONTINUE-FLAG) ✅ Correct
- `main.cob:15-35` (Menu display and EVALUATE) ✅ Correct
- `data.cob:9` - ⚠️ **INCORRECT**: Should be `data.cob:6` (STORAGE-BALANCE is on line 6, not 9)
- `operations.cob:8` (FINAL-BALANCE) ✅ Correct

**Action Required:** Correct BRD line 12 reference from `data.cob:9` to `data.cob:6`.

# Enterprise COBOL → Python Modernization (PoC Case Study)

> **A complete, production‑style path from terminal COBOL to a Python REST API and web dashboard — with 100% functional parity and full requirements traceability.**

**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · Pydantic v2 · SQLAlchemy 2.0 · Alembic · pytest  
**Data:** SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) · Golden‑master parity tests  
**Docs:** BRD + FRD + validation report with 100% coverage and alignment

---

## 🔎 What This Repository Proves (at a glance)

- **Reverse‑engineered legacy** COBOL (`main.cob`, `operations.cob`, `data.cob`) into formal requirements (**BRD** / **FRD**).
- Encoded **9 Business Rules (BR‑01..BR‑09)** and **6 Validation Rules (VR‑01..VR‑06)** as **pure Python functions**.
- Delivered a **clean architecture** Python service (REST API + dashboard) with **repository pattern**, DTOs, migrations, logging, and monitoring hooks.
- Achieved **100% functional parity** using **golden‑master tests**, with **85 tests** (unit + integration + parity) and **100% coverage** on business logic.
- Produced **auditable traceability** from COBOL → BRD/FRD → code → tests.

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This PoC modernizes a terminal‑based **COBOL accounting system** into a **FastAPI** service and **zero‑dependency web dashboard**, preserving original behavior **exactly** and adding the operational capabilities expected in enterprise environments (API, audit trail, tests, CI/CD readiness).

**Key Achievements**
- ✅ Systematic analysis of COBOL codebase  
- ✅ BRD/FRD with **traceability** and **100% alignment**  
- ✅ **Business rules as code** (pure functions)  
- ✅ Repository pattern + DTOs + migrations  
- ✅ **100% parity** via golden‑master tests  
- ✅ Modern UI mirroring COBOL flows  
- ✅ Ready for **PostgreSQL**, logging, and monitoring

## 🏢 Business Context (from BRD)

- **Challenge:** critical COBOL logic, limited UX, high maintenance, hard integration.  
- **Objective:** keep behavior, add API + dashboard, enable audit & integration, reduce cost.  
- **Legacy scope:** menu‑based balance inquiry/credit/debit with file persistence.

## 🛠️ The Modernization Approach (6 Phases)

> Each phase emits auditable artifacts, kept in `docs/` and code under `python-accounting-app/`.

1. **Legacy Analysis** — static review, data‑flow mapping, **9 BR** extracted  
   *Deliverables:* `docs/rules/*`

2. **Requirements Engineering** — **BRD** (business) + **FRD** (technical) + cross‑validation  
   *Deliverables:* `docs/Brd.md`, `docs/Frd.md`, validation reports

3. **Architecture & Design** — clean architecture, domain entities, **money in cents**, pure BR/VR  
   *Deliverable:* `python-accounting-app/ARCHITECTURE.md`

4. **Implementation** — FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, repositories, DTOs  
   *Deliverable:* `python-accounting-app/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`

5. **Quality Assurance** — unit + integration + **golden‑master parity** tests  
   *Outcome:* 85 tests, 0 failures, 100% logic coverage

6. **User Interface** — responsive, zero‑dependency dashboard mirroring COBOL menu flows  
   *Deliverable:* `docs/dashboard-compliance.md`
